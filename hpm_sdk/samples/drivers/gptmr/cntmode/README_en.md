# GPTMR EXTERNAL COUNTER MODE

## Overview

The sample demonstrates the GPTMR external counting mode function. The counter increments on the rising edge of the input capture signal. When the count value reaches the reload value
a reload interrupt occurs and the interrupt function flips the LED.

## Board Setting

Please refer to [Pin Description](lab_board_resource) for specific board.
Connect external PWM signal to GPTMR capture pin.

## Note

The example uses a default reload value of 0xFFFF. For better observation of LED blinking, it suggests using an external PWM frequency above 50KHz.

## Running the example

When running the example, it performs the external counting mode of GPTMR, displaying the following message on the serial terminal and causing the onboard LED to blink

```console
