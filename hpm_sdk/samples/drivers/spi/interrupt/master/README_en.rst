SPI_INTERRUPT_MASTER
========================================

Overview
--------

The spi_interrupt_master example shows how to use spi driver as master to do board to board transfer with interrupt.
In this example, one spi instance as master and another spi instance on other board as slave. Master sends a piece of data to slave, and receives a piece of data from slave. This example checks if the data received from slave is correct.

Board Setting
-------------

Connect  :ref:`SPI Pins <board_resource>`  of the two boards.

the two boards must be connected to the GND of both sides for a common ground to ensure signal transmission.

Running the example
-------------------

- Run slave first, and then run master.

- When the example runs successfully, the log would be seen on the terminal like:
