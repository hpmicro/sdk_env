UART hardware rx idle detection
==============================================================

Overview
--------

In this example project, UART using hardware rx idle detection function to receive variable length data via DMA(data size less than defined BUFFER_SIZE in program).

Port Settings
-------------

- Serial port baud rate is set to ``115200bps`` , with ``one stop bit``  and ``no parity bit``

Board Setting
-------------

- No special settings are required

Running the example
-------------------

When the project runs correctly, input some data by the serial port terminal, then the terminal will output the information like:

.. code-block:: console

   uart hardware rx idle detection.
   uart receive 13 bytes, the received data are:
   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0
   1 2 3
