# uart_lin_slave_baudrate_adaptive
## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of PLB to detect LIN baudrate and UART as LIN slave achieves adaptive transmission and reception of LIN frame.

## Note
- The interval between data frames should be greater than or equal to the transmission time of 4 UART bytes.
- The slave automatic sleep function is not supported, the master no need to wake up slave.

## Board Setting

- On development boards without onboard LIN transceivers:
  Need a LIN transceiver and a USB_LIN debugger
  Connect the UART TX/RX pins on the development board to the TX/RX signal of the LIN transceiver, and connect the USB_LIN debugger to the LIN signal of the LIN transceiver.
- On development boards with onboard LIN transceivers:
  Need a USB_LIN debugger
  Connect the LIN signal and GND of the debugger to the corresponding pins on the development board.
- connect the UART RX pin to the PLB LIN clock detection pin to achieve PLB monitoring of LIN baudrate.

Please refer to [Pin Description](lab_board_resource) for specific board.

## Running the example

configure usb_lin debugger:
- configure com and baudrate, then click `Set to Debugger` option
  ![lin_debugger_configuration](../../../lin/doc/lin_debugger_configuration.png)
- Configure sent data, including master sent, master receiveï¼š
  ![lin_debugger_master_sent](../../../lin/slave/doc/lin_debugger_master_sent_config.png)
- Running the example, check the result in debugger window
  ![lin_debugger_master_result](../../../lin/slave/doc/lin_debugger_master_result.png)

When the example runs successfully, using the USB_LIN debugger to send data frames, the serial terminal will output the following information. Adjust the LIN baud rate in the debugger, and the program will also receive it correctly:
```console
Test uart lin slave baudrate adaptive example
uart lin receive ID: 0x31
uart receive 8 data:
0x0 0x1 0x2 0x3 0x4 0x5 0x6 0x7
uart lin receive ID: 0x30
uart send 8 data:
0x7 0x6 0x5 0x4 0x3 0x2 0x1 0x0
```
