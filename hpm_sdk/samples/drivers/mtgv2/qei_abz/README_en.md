# MTGV2 QEI ABZ example

## Overview

The MTGV2 QEI ABZ routine demonstrates the function of using a QEI ABZ type encoder as data input, processing it through MTGV2 filters, and compensating it for time through trajectory prediction modules. The routine outputs the raw data of QEI and the data processed by MTGV2, and outputs the difference between the two.

## Board Setting
