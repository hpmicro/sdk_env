# MTGV2 SEI tamagawa example

## Overview

The MTGV2 SEI tamagawa routine demonstrates the function of using SEI to communicate with the tamagawa encoder to obtain data, which is processed by the MTGV2 filter, and time compensated by the trajectory prediction module. The routine outputs the raw data of SEI and the data processed by MTGV2, and outputs the difference between the two.

## Board Setting

- Connect master's SEI pins DATA_P/DATA_N to encoder data pins.
- Connect encoder VDD/GND to board +5V/GND.
