MCAN
========

Overview
--------

The mcan_demo provides the following features:
- loopback test for all SoC supported CAN controllers, focusing on the CAN and CAN-FD test

- loopback test for the board supported CAN controllers using interrupt mode

- Dual-board Echo test

- Send out multiple messages for the CAN bus connection check

- CAN filter test

- CAN RXBUF test

- CAN Timestamp test

Board Setting
-------------

No special settings are required

Running the example
-------------------

When the example runs successfully, the board shows the following menu:

Note:
~~~~~

- For option 0 and option 1, users can start the test by typing the option directly

- For option 2 and 3, users must connect two boards and run this demo, start the responder first, then start the initiator.

- For option 4, users must ensure that the board is attached to a valid CAN bus. If the board is connected to a CAN monitor, and users can see multiple messages will be sent out after this option is chosen.
