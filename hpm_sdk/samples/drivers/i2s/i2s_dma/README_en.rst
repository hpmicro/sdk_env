Overview
--------

This example shows I2S transfer audio data with DMA to audio codec on board.

---------------------

- In the file `CMakeLists.txt`, set a matched audio codec type according to the development board schematicï¼Œe.g. "set(CONFIG_CODEC "sgtl5000")"

Board Setting
-------------

- Connect headphone to the  :ref:`headphone <board_resource>`  interface on the audio codec chip.

Known Issue
