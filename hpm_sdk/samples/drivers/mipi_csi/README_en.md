# MIPI_CSI

## Overview

The example project demonstrates capturing video data from a camera using the `MIPI_CSI` interface. The captured video data is received by `CAM` and displayed on the screen through the buffer.

## Hardware Setup

1. Connect the camera and screen to the video expansion board.
2. Connect the video expansion board to the development board.

## Project Configuration

- the sample does not support RGB LCD screen due to the hardware design conflict between onboard RGB and mipi csi pins.
modify `board/xxx/CMakeLists.txt` to select the corresponding panel type (LVDS or MIPI).

## Notes

- Camera support: OV5640
- Panel support: MIPI or LVDS interface

## Running Phenomenon

Once the project runs correctly, the screen will display the video data from the camera. The serial terminal will output the following information:

```console

I2C bus is ready
