UAC2 Speaker and Microphone
======================================================

Overview
--------

This example project shows USB hid generic transfers

- PC transmits a HID report to MCU,  and then MC send it back to PC

Board Setting
-------------

- Connect a USB port on PC to the PWR DEBUG port on the development board with a USB Type-C cable

- Connect a USB port on PC to one of USB port on the development board with a USB Type-C cable

- Connect a speaker to the DAO interface on the development board

Project Configuration
---------------------

- File `CMakeLists.txt`ï¼š

  When BOARD_DEVICE_RHPORT_NUM is defined as 0, it means to use USB0.

  When BOARD_DEVICE_RHPORT_NUM is defined as 1, it means to use USB1.
- The property of USB device can be configured by "tusb_config.h" or "CMakeListx.txt"
