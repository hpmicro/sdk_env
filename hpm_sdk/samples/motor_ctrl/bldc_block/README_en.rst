BLDC BLOCK
====================

Overview
--------

**Bldc_block** project demonstrates speed control of the BLDC.
- Control by trapezoidal wave algorithm
- Support both HALL sensor and QEI encoder for position detection
- Use PID algorithm for speed closed-loop control
- Support forward and reverse rotation control

Configurations
--------------

- This program uses the **BLM57050-1000** brushless motor of "Leisai Intelligence", refer to the `Leisai Intelligence <https://leisai.com/>`_ website for the specific parameters of the motor.

- Board settings refer to the development board documentation :ref:`Motor Pin <board_resource>` related content

    - SOCs without the HALL peripheral need to connect the HALL signal from the motor board to the QEI pin on the motor interface of the development board
    - Ensure PWM frequency is set to 20kHz
    - Ensure motor pole pairs is 2

Running the Demo
----------------

The motor runs at a speed of 20r/s.
The following data can be configured by serial consoleï¼š

``speed`` float, range +40~+5 -40~-5 0, unit r/s
- Positive value for forward rotation
- Negative value for reverse rotation
- 0 for stop

The serial console message is as follows:

.. code-block:: console

   Speed mode, motor run, speed is: 20.000000.
   Input speed:

   Speed mode, motor run, speed is: 10.500000.
   Input speed:

.. warning::

   Pay attention to the current size, when abnormalities occur, please cut off the power at any time
