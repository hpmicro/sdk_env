# tsn_frame_preemption_egress

## Overview

This example shows TSN preemption (IEEE802.1 Qbu)  input

- Observe the receiving sequence of data frames at the receiving end

  - The sender sends the preemtible traffic first, then the express traffic, and the receiver receives the express traffic first, then the preemtible traffic.

    Note: The receiving order is from the CPU point of view.
- Observe FPE and RX-Time at the receiving end

  - PFE is 1 and RX-Time is 0 for the preemtible traffic,  while FPE is 0 and RX-Time is non-zero for the express traffic.
- Observe whether the value of the FPE Assembly Ok Counter is incremented synchronously with the sender

  - Synchronous increment indicates successful receipt of preemptible traffic.

## Board Settings

- Connect a USB port on PC to the PWR DEBUG port on the development board with a USB Type-C cable
- Connect an Ethernet port on PC to a RGMII port on the development board with an Ethernet cable

## Project Configurations

- None

## Run Example

- Compiling and Downloading
- Running log is shown in the serial terminal as follows:
