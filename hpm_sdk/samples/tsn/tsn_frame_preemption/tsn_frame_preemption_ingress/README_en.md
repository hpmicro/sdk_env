# tsn_frame_preemption_ingress

## Overview

This example shows TSN frame preemption(IEEE802.1 Qbu) output

- Observe the value of  fragment tx counter from MMS
  - Increment indicates that the preemptible traffic is successfully sent.
- On the receiving end, run the sample tsn_frame_preemption_egress on another development board and observe the order of the receiving frame and the value of  assembly ok counter.

## Board Settings

- Connect a USB port on PC to the PWR DEBUG port on the development board with a USB Type-C cable
- Connect RGMII ports on the two development board with an Ethernet cable

## Project Configurations

- None

## Run Example

- Compiling and Downloading
- Running log is shown in the serial terminal as follows:
