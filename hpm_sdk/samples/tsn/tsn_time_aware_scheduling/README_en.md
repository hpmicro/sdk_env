# tsn_time_aware_scheduling

## Overview

This example shows TSN TAS(IEEE802.1 Qbv) traffic shaper output

- Watch traffic shaper output through an Ethernet packet capture tool on PC

## Board Settings

- Connect a USB port on PC to the PWR DEBUG port on the development board with a USB Type-C cable
- Connect an Ethernet port on PC to a RGMII port on the development board with an Ethernet cable

## Project Configurations

- None

## Run Example

- Compiling and Downloading
- Running log is shown in the serial terminal as follows:

  ```console
  This is a TSW demo: Time Aware Scheduing
  TSW phy init passed !
  Link Status: Down
  Link Status: Up
  Link Speed:  1000Mbps
  Link Duplex: Full duplex
  ```
- Run an Ethernet packet capture tool

  - set a filter rule: eth.src == 98:2c:bc:b1:9f:17 and arp

    **Note: There is a necessary adjustment for "eth.src" according to the actual TSN mac**
  - Watch the traffic sharper output: traffic interval/traffic cycle
