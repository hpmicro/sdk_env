# tsn_psfp_egress

## Overview

This example shows TSN per-stream filtering and policing (IEEE802.1Qci) input

- Observe whether the length of the incoming traffic is within the limit

  - Enable  size filtering:  Allows traffic through a limited length.
- Observe whether the incoming traffic is controlled by gating

  - Enable static gating filtering:  The static gating configuration determines whether to allow traffic through.
  - Enable dynamic gating filtering: The dynamic gating status determines whether to allow traffic through.
- Observe whether the incoming traffic is within the bandwidth limit

  - Enable flow metering: Allows traffic through within  the specified (or excess) bandwidth.

## Board Settings

- Connect a USB port on PC to the PWR DEBUG port on the development board with a USB Type-C cable
- Connect an Ethernet port on PC to a RGMII port on the development board with an Ethernet cable

## Project Configurations

- None

## Run Example
