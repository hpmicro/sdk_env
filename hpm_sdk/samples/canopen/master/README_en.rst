CANOPEN_MASTER
==============

Overview
--------

The canopen_master_demo provides the following features:

- HeartBeat test

- NMT test

- SDO test

- PDO test

Board Setting
-------------

Download master routines on one board, download slave routines on another board, connect two boards

Running Steps
-------------

After the program is successfully downloaded, master will enter a loop to wait for slave message. If the slave is in initial/pre optional/optional state, read the nodeid. Otherwise, continue the loop to wait

Read message from the slave through PDO based on the nodeid

Read/write message from/to the slave through SDO based on the nodeid

Note: This sample is intended to provide a simple presentation of the canopen communication process. Canopen supports one master and multiple slaves, but this sample only supports one master and one slave

Running the example
-------------------

When the example runs successfully, the board shows the following:

.. code-block:: console

   enter master mode and find slave device ~~
   rxSize = 11, txSize = 8
   excessive number of concurrent CAN RX filters enabled (needs 11, 16 available)

Test steps
~~~~~~~~~~

The current routine is the master role of canopen. The board runs the current routine and connects to the board running the slave role.

If success, Master board show asï¼š

.. code-block:: console

   enter master mode and find slave device ~~
   rxSize = 11, txSize = 8
   excessive number of concurrent CAN RX filters enabled (needs 11, 16 available)
   find device, id:70a, status preoptional
   slave enter to optional mode
   PDO test successfully!
   slave HBtime: 1000 ms
   slave HBtime: 2000 ms
   SDO test successfully!
   canopen test done
