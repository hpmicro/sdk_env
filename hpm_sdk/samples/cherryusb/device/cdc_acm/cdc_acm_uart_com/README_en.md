# CDC ACM Uart COM

## Overview

This example project shows USB CDC Serial

- PC sees a serial port via Device Manager
- The USB CDC ACM is used to the UART serial port of the MCU, and the pins description in the readme of the board folder, which name is USB_CDC_ACM_UART.
- The UART receives data using DMA cyclic reception method. Start the timer to periodically query data, and if there is any data, it will be sent out through a USB IN transaction.
- UART sends data in DMA normal mode. When the USB OUT transaction receives data, UART DMA sends data.
- The UART rx buffer of the application is read every 5ms, with a buffer size of 512, so the maximum baudrate is 921600. If users wish to increase the maximum baudrate, they can shorten the timer period or increase the UART rx buffer.

## Board Setting

- Connect a USB port on PC to the PWR DEBUG port on the development board with a USB Type-C cable
- Connect a USB port on PC to one of USB port on the development board with a USB Type-C cable
- Using USB to TTL level serial port module, USB side connected to computer, UART side connected to USB_CDC_ACM_UART pins

## Running the example

- Download the program to the development board and run it. The computer can automatically recognize and install the serial port driver, and list a COM port device called COM_A.
- Connect USB to TTL level serial port module to computer, the computer recognizes a COM port device called COM_B.
- Open two "Serial Port Debugging Assistant" software, with the same communication settings(baudrate, parity, etc.), and one open COM_A, one open COM_B.
- Enter characters in the serial port debugging assistant of COM_A, click send, COM_B's serial port debugging assistant will receive the characters. Enter characters in the serial port debugging assistant of COM_B, click send, COM_A's serial port debugging assistant will receive the characters.
