# CDC ACM Host

## Overview

This example project shows USB CDC ACM HOST.

## Board Setting

- We need two development boards, one board as the CDC ACM Host and the other board as the CDC ACM Device.
- CDC ACM Device sample path is `samples/cherryusb/device/cdc_acm/cdc_acm_vcom`, and host is this example.
- Connect the USB0 ports of the Host and Device.

## Running the example

- Download the program to the development board and run it. Use the serial debugging assistant to view the output log
- Press the PBUT or USER_KEYA button on the Host development board, and the HOST will send the "HPMicro" string to the Device. Once the Device receives it, it will return the "HPMicro" string to the Host.
