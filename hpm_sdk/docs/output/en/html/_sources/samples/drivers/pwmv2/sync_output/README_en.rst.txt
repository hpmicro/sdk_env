PWM Synchronous Output
============================================

Overiew
-------

PWM supports the multi-channel synchronous output function. This example demonstrates synchronizing three channels of PWM through the **synt**  of the motor system, and the PWM waveforms are output via the corresponding pins of the MCU

Configurations
--------------

- Oscilloscope

- Install the serial terminal, view  :ref:`board information <board_resource>` , and configure the serial terminal parameters

-  :ref:`PWM_P0, PWM_P2, PWM_P4 pins <board_resource>`  Check the information according to the board model

Running the Demo
----------------

- After power-on, the three channels of PWM output at the same time and in the same phase. Then different phase synchronous outputs are achieved through the trigger signal of **synt**

- The output of P0 has a 45-degree phase difference from that of P2, and the output of P0 has a 135-degree phase difference from that of P4

- Serial port printing information:


.. code-block:: console

       pwmv2 three pwm submodule synchronous example
       choose PWM output channel [P0 P2 P4]


       >> P0 P2 P4 generate waveform at same time
       P0 is a reference


       >> Phase different P0 P2 P4 is 45 degrees 135 degrees
       P0 is a reference
       test done



- The obtained waveforms are shown in the figure

    The yellow one is the output of P0<br>
    The pink one is the output of P2<br>
    The blue one is the output of P4

.. note::

   Output the PWM waveform once, and if you observe the waveform again, you need to run the program again.
