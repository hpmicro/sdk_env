lin_slave
==================

Overview
--------

The lin_slave sample project shows that LIN sends/receives data at slave mode.

Board Setting
-------------

Requires a LIN transceiver and USB_LIN debugger
Please refer to  :ref:`Pin Description <board_resource>`  for specific board.
connect LIN transceiver mcu signal to LIN's TX and RX on board, connect LIN transceiver LIN signal to USB_LIN debugger.

Running the example
-------------------

configure usb_lin debugger:
- configure com and baudrate, then click `Set to Debugger` option

  .. image:: ../../../../../../samples/drivers/lin/doc/lin_debugger_configuration.png
     :alt: lin_debugger_configuration

- Configure sent data, including master sent, master receive and sync break, the sync break could wake up slave from sleep mode：

- Running the example, check the result in debugger window

  .. image:: ../../../../../../samples/drivers/lin/slave/doc/lin_debugger_master_result.png

When the example runs successfully, the log would be seen on the terminal like:

.. code-block:: console
