# RDC

## Overview

The rdc example project demo position information from a rotary encoder.

## Board Setting

Connect the rotary encoder driver board to the motor interface (Please refer to  [RDC Pin Description](lab_board_resource)), then connect the rotary encoder to the driver board.

- Driver board 14V power supply
- RDC model **SG52-4-G12.7**
- RDC encoder have 4 pole, so one turn of the electrical angle corresponds to 1/4 turns of the actual position.
- The start position of the RDC encoder needs to ensure that there is enough voltage in both phases to acquire the over-zero position, otherwise there will be an error in the position during the movement.

## Running the example

Rotate the motor and the serial terminal will output the angle information as follows:
```console
 theta: 1.
 theta: 20.5.
```
