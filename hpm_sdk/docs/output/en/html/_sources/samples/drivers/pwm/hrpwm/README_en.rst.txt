HRPwm Output
========================

Overiew
-------

**pwm**  project configures several different types of waveforms and outputs them.

- Forced output

- Fault mode

- Edge-aligned

- Center-aligned

Configurations
--------------

- Dual Channel Oscilloscope

- Install the serial terminal, view  :ref:`board information <board_resource>` , and configure the serial terminal parameters

-  :ref:`HRPWM_P0 and HRPWM_P2 pins <board_resource>`  Check the information according to the board model

Running the Demo
----------------

- After power on, the oscilloscope can observe P0, P1 output high level, low level, edge-aligned PWM and center-aligned PWM

- Compared with the reference PWM, the HRPWM output pulse width differs by `HRPWM_SET_IN_PWM_CLK` clock cycles

- Serial port printing information:

   hr pwm example


   >> Test force HRPWM output on P0 and P2
   Output high
   Output low


   >> Generate edge aligned waveform
   Two waveforms will be generated, HRPWM P0 is the target waveform
   whose duty cycle will be updated from 0 - 100 and back to 0; HRPWM P2 is a reference


   >> Generate central aligned waveform
   Two waveforms will be generated, HRPWM P0 is the target waveform
   whose duty cycle will be updated from 0 - 100 and back to 0; HRPWM P2 is a reference
   test done


.. note::

   Output the PWM waveform once, and if you observe the waveform again, you need to run the program again.
