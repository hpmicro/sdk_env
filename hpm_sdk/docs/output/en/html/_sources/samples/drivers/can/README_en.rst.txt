CAN
======

Overview
--------

The can_demo provides the following features:

- loopback test for all SoC supported CAN controllers, focusing on the CAN and CAN-FD test

- loopback test for the board supported CAN controllers using interrupt mode

- Dual-board Echo test

- Send out multiple messages for the CAN bus connection check

- CAN Error Detection

- CAN Filter

Board Setting
-------------

No special settings are required

Running the example
-------------------

When the example runs successfully, the board shows the following menu:

Note
~~~~

- For option 0 and option 1, users can start the test by typing the option directly

- For option 2 and 3, users must connect two boards and run this demo, start the responder first, then start the initiator.

- For option 4, users must ensure that the board is attached to a valid CAN bus. If the board is connected to a CAN monitor, users can see multiple CAN messages will be sent out after this option is chosen.

- For option 7, users must ensure that the board is attached to a valid CAN bus and the bus now supports 5Mbits/s CANFD baudrate. If the board is connected

to a CANFD monitor, users will see multiple CANFD messages are sent out after this option is chosen.
