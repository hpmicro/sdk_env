# Hello demo

## Overview

The multi-core example project runs a serial port echo example on Core0 and a GPIO toggles RGB LEDs in GPTMR interrupt example on Core1.

In this project:
 - The serial port outputs "hello world"; Manually input the stirng information through the keyboard and print it through the serial port
 - The RGB leds are switching among RED, GREEN, BLUE respectively.


## Board Setting

  BOOT_PIN should be configured to 0-OFF, 1-OFF

## Generate, Build and Debug Multi-core projects

Please reference[Multicore General Description.md](../README_en.md)

## Running Results
- Taking HPM6750EVKMINI as an example, when the project runs successfully, the serial port terminal will output the following information:
    ```console
        Copying secondary core image to destination memory: 0x1180000
        Hello world for multicore! Secondary core control RGB leds blinking...
    ```
- The RGB leds are switching among RED, GREEN, BLUE respectively.
