Microros Publisher Performance Test
======================================================================

Overview
--------

The publisher example demonstrates the message publishing function of microros nodes through XRCE-Client。

Board Setting
-------------

- One ubuntu host with ROS2 foxy version installed

- Connect the host to the development board using a USB to serial port. The serial port number used by the development board can be found in board.h.

Environment Setup
-----------------

ros2 foxy install:

1. Installation steps on the official website [https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Installation/Alternatives/Ubuntu-Development-Setup.html].

2. Installing through APT(If necessary，change the source of ubuntu)

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install ros-foxy-desktop

After installing ROS2 foxy, it is necessary to install the agent on the host side, which is installed through Docker

.. code-block:: bash

   docker run -it --rm --net=host -v /dev/shm:/dev/shm -v /dev:/dev --privileged microros/micro-ros-agent:foxy serial --dev ${serial}

If you encounter a situation where the serial port cannot be opened, please change the permissions for the serial port

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo chmod -R 777 ${serial}

After running the agent, reset the board.

.. note::

   - Currently, the static library linked by microros is compiled by GCC 11.1.0 and Andes Toolchain v520.

Running the example
-------------------

Open a new terminal

.. code-block:: bash

   source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash

- type `ros2 node list` You can see the "publisher" node.
- type `ros2 topic list` You can see /int32_Publisher topic name.
- type `ros2 node info /publisher` You can query node functions and message types
- type `ros2 topic echo /int32_publisher` You can see the content of the published message. In this example, a 32-bit number is sent every 1 second, increasing each time.

.. code-block:: bash
