MCU send back the received data to codec component, then codec component decodes and plays the audio data.

Project Configuration
---------------------

- In the file `CMakeLists.txt`, set a matched audio codec type according to the development board schematicï¼Œe.g. "set(CONFIG_CODEC "sgtl5000")"

Board Setting
-------------

- According to project configuration, connect speaker to  :ref:`DAO <board_resource>`  interface if using DAO as player, connect headphone to  :ref:`headphone <board_resource>`  interface if using audio codec as player.

Known issues
------------

When using DAO to play some audio, it may generate noise.
