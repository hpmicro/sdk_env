- Ethernet Port Settings: Refer to :ref:`Ethernet common project settings <ethernet_port_configurations_en>`

- By `set(CONFIG_ECLIPSE_THREADX_NETXDUO_ADDONS_DHCP 1)` in CMakeLists.txt, the DHCP will be enabled

Running the example

When the example runs successfully, it will send udp message **"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ "**  to **ECHO_SERVER_ADDRESS : ECHO_SERVER_PORT** (192.168.1.2:7777) through port **ECHO_SEND_PORT** (7777) and then wait for receive udp message with a timeout. It will print phy link status periodically until its status becomes **Up** . If received udp message, it will also print it to the console. Following message is displayed in the terminal:
