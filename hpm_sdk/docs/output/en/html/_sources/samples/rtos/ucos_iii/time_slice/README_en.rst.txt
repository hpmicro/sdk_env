uC/OS-III Time Slice
========================================

Overview
--------

The example shows uC/OS-III time slice scheduling feature.

Board Setting
-------------

No special settings are required

Running the example
-------------------

When the example runs successfully, task float will print runtimes and five numbers, led0_task will print runtimes and "LED : 12345".
The dual task are created at same priority, and both of the task does not call sched functions to trigger task switch. So without time slice scheduling method, it will run only one of the tasks. Because of time slice scheduling feature, tasks at same priority will be scheduled.
"run x times" message will be print to console without task schedule because CPU_CRITICAL_ENTER() is called.
Other message maybe interrupted randomly.
following message is displayed in the terminal:
